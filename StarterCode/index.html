          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <br>

          <p><strong>Household Income</strong> shows to have a strong correlation with all 3 dimensions analyzed.
                <ul>
                  <li>Greater the household income, lower the % of people W/O Healthcare, Smoking and Obese.</li>
                  <li>Arkansas, West Virginia, Mississippi have over 35% of obese population with median household income of 41K. Colorado has lowest % of obese population (21%)</li>
                  <li>Kentucky, West Virginia has over 26% of people smoking with 41K of median household. Utah has lowest % of smoking population (9%) with 60K Median income.
                  <li>Texas has 24.9% of population W/O healthcare and Massachusetts ranked lowest in % of people w/o healthcare.</li>
                </ul>
          </p>

          <p><strong>Poverty: </strong> plays a pivotal role in % of Obese population. 
                <ul>
                  <li>This substantiates the effect of household income on Obesity we saw in our previous analysis. </li>
                  <li>To my surprise, did not notice a strong correlation between Poverty and population without healthcare.</li>
                  <li>States with greater poverty % also seems to have more people smoking. West Virginia has over 26% of people smoking with 18.3% of population in poverty, followed by Kentucky.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

          <p><strong>Age: </strong>
            <ul>
              <li>People between 36 and 44 of age seems to strong correlation with Obese and Smoking.</li>
              <li>As people age, % of population W/O healthcare drops.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
