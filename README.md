Household Income shows to have a strong correlation with all 3 dimensions analyzed.
•	Greater the household income, lower the % of people W/O Healthcare, Smoking and Obese.
•	Arkansas, West Virginia, Mississippi have over 35% of obese population with median household income of 41K. Colorado has lowest % of obese population (21%)
•	Kentucky, West Virginia has over 26% of people smoking with 41K of median household. Utah has lowest % of smoking population (9%) with 60K Median income.
•	Texas has 24.9% of population W/O healthcare and Massachusetts ranked lowest in % of people w/o healthcare.

Poverty: plays a pivotal role in % of Obese population. 
•	This substantiates the effect of household income on Obesity we saw in our previous analysis. 
•	To my surprise, did not notice a strong correlation between Poverty and population without healthcare.
•	States with greater poverty % also seems to have more people smoking. West Virginia has over 26% of people smoking with 18.3% of population in poverty, followed by Kentucky.

Age:
•	People between 36 and 44 of age seems to strong correlation with Obese and Smoking.
•	As people age, % of population W/O healthcare drops.
